## Stacks

I will majorly use Angular, but maybe I will have some of them in other frameworks, like React, Vue, Qwik...

One increment to the projects that I want to do is add some back-end to some projects. I will add them with Node.js and express and fastfy but also I'm learning Golang, and I really want to create somethings with it!

## About me

Hi, my name is Rafael Lima and I'm a software engineer with 2 years of experience. My main stack is Angular (frontend) and Node.js (backend) with Typescript. I am like a lot of Functional Programming paradigm and I really like to code in a reactive way (at least I try most of the times hahaha).

Please, feel free to contribute or give me feedbacks. I'll be happy to talk with you!
